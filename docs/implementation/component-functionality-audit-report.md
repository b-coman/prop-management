- **Impact**: Booking functionality broken in modern system
- **Risk Level**: 🚨 Critical - Revenue impact
- **Required Action**: Integrate with booking system V2
- **Effort**: Large (1+ weeks)

#### 2. **ContactSection Functionality Missing**
- **Problem**: Legacy ContactSection has no modern equivalent
- **Impact**: Host contact functionality lost
- **Risk Level**: 🔴 High - User experience degradation
- **Required Action**: Create modern contact component or integrate into booking flow
- **Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

#### 3. **Data Structure Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Legacy flat property structure vs modern block-based structure
- **Impact**: Existing property data needs transformation
- **Risk Level**: 🟡 Medium - Migration complexity
- **Required Action**: Implement data transformation layer (partially complete with Task #39)
- **Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)

#### 4. **Component Feature Gaps**
- **Problem**: Some legacy component features not replicated in modern equivalents
- **Impact**: Feature regression during migration
- **Examples**:
  - AmenitiesSection icon mapping completeness
  - RulesSection time display formatting
  - PropertyDetailsSection responsive behavior
- **Required Action**: Feature parity validation and enhancement
- **Effort**: Small to Medium per component

### 🟢 Low Priority Enhancements

#### 5. **Enhanced Modern Features Not Utilized**
- **Opportunity**: Modern components offer features not in legacy system
- **Examples**:
  - GalleryGrid lightbox and multiple layouts
  - PhotoCategories organization
  - PoliciesList accordion interface
  - FullMap interactive features
- **Action**: Update property data to leverage new capabilities
- **Effort**: Ongoing optimization

## Migration Strategy by Component

### 🏁 Phase 1: Critical Path (Foundation)
1. **FullBookingForm → Booking V2 Integration**
   - Update to use modern booking components
   - Test booking flow end-to-end
   - Verify payment integration

2. **Data Transformation Layer**
   - Complete implementation of override transformers (Task #39 ✅)
   - Test with real property data
   - Handle edge cases and validation

### 🚀 Phase 2: Direct Replacements (Enhancement)
3. **PropertyDetailsSection → SpecificationsList**
   - Map existing property fields to name-value pairs
   - Ensure responsive behavior maintained
   - Test with various property types

4. **AmenitiesSection → AmenitiesList** 
   - Convert flat amenity arrays to categorized structure
   - Verify icon mapping completeness
   - Enhance with new amenity types

5. **RulesSection → PoliciesList**
   - Transform rules and times to policy format
   - Implement accordion behavior
   - Maintain check-in/out time display

6. **MapSection → FullMap**
   - Migrate from iframe to Google Maps API
   - Add interactive features
   - Implement fallback handling

### 🎨 Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Migration)
7. **Gallery Enhancement**
   - Migrate to GalleryGrid with layout options
   - Optionally implement PhotoCategories for larger galleries
   - Add lightbox functionality

8. **Contact Integration**
   - Determine contact strategy (standalone component vs booking integration)
   - Implement host contact functionality
   - Integrate with inquiry system
