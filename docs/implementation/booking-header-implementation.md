# Booking Header Implementation

## Overview
Added a simple, light booking header to the V2 booking system to provide navigation and accessibility features during the booking flow.

## Implementation Date
June 4, 2025

## Problem Addressed
The V2 booking system lacked any header navigation, creating a poor user experience where users:
- Couldn't navigate back to property details during booking
- Had no access to currency/language switching in booking flow
- Lost context of which property they were booking

## Solution Implemented

### Header Design
Simple, minimal header following mobile-first UX best practices:
- **Mobile**: Back button + property name + currency/language selectors
- **Desktop**: Back to property + currency/language selectors on right

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified:
1. **`src/components/booking-v2/containers/BookingPageV2.tsx`**
   - Added mobile sticky header with backdrop blur
   - Added desktop header with flex layout
   - Imported currency/language selector components
   - Updated to V2.4 with proper file header documentation

2. **`src/app/booking/check/[slug]/page.tsx`**
   - Removed unused `ClientHeader` import (dead code cleanup)

#### Components Used:
- `CurrencySwitcherSimple` - For currency selection
- `LanguageSelector` - For language switching
- `ArrowLeft` from Lucide React - Back button icon
- Next.js `Link` component - Navigation

### Visual Design
- **Sticky positioning** with proper z-index layering
- **Backdrop blur** for modern glass morphism effect
- **Hover animations** on interactive elements
- **Responsive spacing** and touch-friendly targets
- **Theme-aware** styling using CSS custom properties

### UX Features
- **Progressive disclosure** - Mobile minimal, desktop full-featured
- **Contextual placement** - Currency selector near booking context
- **Smooth transitions** - Hover states and animations
- **Accessibility** - Semantic navigation and proper contrast

## Code Example

```tsx
{/* Mobile Sticky Header */}
<div className="sticky top-0 z-40 bg-background/95 backdrop-blur supports-[backdrop-filter]:bg-background/60 border-b border-border md:hidden">
  <div className="container px-4 py-3">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
      <Link href={`/properties/${property.slug}`}>
        <ArrowLeft className="h-4 w-4" />
        <span>Back</span>
      </Link>
      <div className="flex-1 text-center">
        <h1>{propertyName}</h1>
      </div>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-1">
        <CurrencySwitcherSimple />
        <LanguageSelector />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Benefits
1. **Improved Navigation** - Clear path back to property details
2. **Better UX** - Users maintain context during booking flow
3. **Feature Access** - Currency/language switching available throughout booking
4. **Modern Design** - Clean, professional appearance that matches site design
5. **Mobile Optimized** - Touch-friendly interface following mobile UX patterns

## Testing

- ✅ Sticky behavior works during scroll

## Additional Improvements Made

### V2.5 Enhancements (Same Session):
1. **Removed Redundant Title** - Eliminated duplicate property name below header
2. **Fixed Currency Issues** - Resolved multiple currency display inconsistencies:
   - Fixed main pricing display showing EUR while selector showed RON
   - Fixed all price breakdown items to respect selected currency
   - Fixed hardcoded EUR hold fees (€25/€50) to convert to selected currency
   - Removed misleading "will be converted at checkout" messages
3. **Fixed Language Selector** - Changed flag emojis to text (EN/RO) for better compatibility

### Technical Fixes:
- Updated `formatPrice` calls throughout pricing components
- Added `convertToSelectedCurrency` before all price displays
- Fixed both desktop and mobile pricing breakdowns
- Ensured consistent currency display across all booking components

## Future Enhancements
- Could add booking progress indicator
- Possible integration with property theme colors
