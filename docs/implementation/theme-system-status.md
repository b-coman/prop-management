   - Primary color: #0078FF (Vibrant blue)

5. **Luxury Estate Theme**
   - Sophisticated dark design with gold accents

## Resolved Issues

1. **Firestore Timestamp Serialization**
   - Issue: "Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components from Server Components" error when passing Firestore timestamp objects to client components in Next.js
   - Solution: Created a serialization utility to convert Firestore timestamps to ISO strings before passing to client components
   - Files updated: 
     - `/src/lib/property-utils.ts` - Added `serializePropertyTimestamps` function
     - `/src/app/admin/properties/[slug]/edit/page.tsx` - Updated to use serialized property data

2. **Theme Selection UI Feedback**
   - Issue: Selected theme and hover states were not visually distinct enough in the ThemeSelector
   - Solution: Enhanced the ThemeSelector component with additional visual feedback including checkmarks, labels, borders, scaling, and shadow effects
   - Files updated:
     - `/src/components/ui/theme-selector.tsx` - Added hover state tracking and enhanced visual indicators

3. **Firestore Rules Permission Issue**
   - Issue: "Missing or insufficient permissions" error when updating properties
   - Solution: Updated Firestore rules to allow property updates during development
   - Files updated:
     - `/firestore.rules` - Temporarily relaxed permissions for properties collection

## Theme Preview Feature

The theme system now includes a powerful preview capability that allows property owners to test different themes on their actual property pages without changing their settings:

1. In the admin property form, each theme card now includes a "Preview Theme" button
2. Clicking this button opens the property page in a new tab with the selected theme applied
3. A banner appears at the top of the page indicating that the user is in preview mode
4. The banner includes options to reload the preview or exit back to the normal theme
5. The preview uses URL parameters (`?preview_theme=theme_id`) to temporarily override the theme

This feature enables property owners to make informed decisions about which theme best suits their property without committing to changes prematurely.

## Next Steps

- **User Testing**: Gather feedback from property owners on theme selection and preview experience
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize theme application performance
- **Additional Themes**: Consider adding more themes based on user feedback
- **Theme Customization**: Consider adding limited customization options within each theme
- **Dark Mode Support**: Add dark mode variants for each theme
