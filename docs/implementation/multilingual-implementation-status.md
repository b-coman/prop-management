   - Resolved language constants export issues
   - Added proper toJSON serialization
   - Updated all components to use tc() function

2. **Data Normalization** 
   - Amenities moved to separate collection

   - Examples: AM/PM, Euro, Check-in/out
   - Note: These are commonly understood and often preferred in Romanian

2. **No Current Critical Issues**
   - All major multilingual bugs resolved
   - System fully functional in both languages

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run Firestore migration in production
2. Deploy multilingual features
3. Monitor user adoption

### Future Enhancements
1. Additional language support
2. Translation management UI
3. Automatic translation integration
4. Regional variations
