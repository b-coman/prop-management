- [ ] Implement occupancy-based price viewer
- [ ] Add filters to show price components (base, seasonal, overrides)
- [ ] Create price comparison view (current vs. previous)
- [ ] Implement booking simulation tool

**Implementation Notes:**
- Focus on visual clarity for different price components
- Use color gradients to show price intensity
- Add hover tooltips with price breakdown

## Phase 3: Booking Integration

### 3.1 Availability API Update (Week 6)

- [ ] Modify availability API to use new priceCalendar collection
- [ ] Add occupancy-based pricing to availability response
- [ ] Implement date range spanning logic for multi-month queries
- [ ] Add caching layer for common queries
- [ ] Create performance-optimized endpoints for calendar views

**Implementation Notes:**
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Add new endpoints with enhanced functionality
- Document API changes for frontend teams

### 3.2 Booking System Integration (Week 6-7)

- [ ] Update booking creation flow to use priceCalendar for price lookup
- [ ] Modify availability checking to correctly handle minimum stay requirements
- [ ] Implement real-time availability updates when bookings are created/modified
- [ ] Add length-of-stay discount application
- [ ] Update booking cancellation to restore availability

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use transactions to ensure data consistency
- Add robust error handling for pricing lookups
- Ensure all booking flows correctly update availability

### 3.3 Calendar UI Updates (Week 7)

- [ ] Update public-facing calendar to show pricing information
- [ ] Implement dynamic price display based on selected guest count
- [ ] Add visual indicators for minimum stay requirements
- [ ] Create pricing tooltip on date hover
- [ ] Implement visual indicators for different price sources

**Implementation Notes:**
- Focus on clean, uncluttered date cells
- Use subtle indicators for special pricing
- Ensure responsive design for mobile views

## Phase 4: Testing and Optimization

### 4.1 System Testing (Week 8)

- [ ] Create comprehensive end-to-end test suite
- [ ] Test boundary conditions (month transitions, year changes)
- [ ] Verify performance with large datasets
- [ ] Load test availability API endpoints
- [ ] Test concurrent booking scenarios

**Implementation Notes:**
- Set up automated testing pipeline
- Document testing coverage and results
- Create test scenarios for common edge cases

### 4.2 Performance Optimization (Week 8)

- [ ] Profile price calculation for optimization opportunities
- [ ] Analyze and optimize Firestore query patterns
- [ ] Implement strategic caching for common scenarios
- [ ] Optimize priceCalendar document size
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring

- [ ] Document system architecture and data flow

**Implementation Notes:**
- Focus on clear explanations with examples
- Create visual guides for complex concepts
- Include administration troubleshooting section

## Migration Strategy

### Preparation

1. Create new collections without affecting existing functionality
2. Build and test pricing engine with existing data
3. Generate initial priceCalendar documents in a staging environment

### Data Migration

1. Add pricing configuration fields to properties with defaults
2. Generate basic seasonal configurations based on industry standards
3. For each property, generate first 12 months of priceCalendar data
4. Verify data integrity before proceeding

### Gradual Rollout

1. Initially run both old and new pricing systems in parallel
2. Switch availability checking to the new system while maintaining fallbacks
3. Gradually enable new admin interfaces for a subset of properties
4. Monitor system performance and data consistency
5. Switch booking creation to use the new pricing system
6. Fully transition all properties after validation period

## Rollback Plan

If issues are detected during rollout:

1. Return availability checking to the old system
2. Restore booking creation to use the original pricing logic
3. Preserve generated priceCalendar data for analysis
4. Investigate and fix issues in a staging environment
5. Retry migration with corrected approach

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All properties have accurate pricing in the new system
2. Admin users can efficiently manage pricing through the new interface
3. Booking operations use the new pricing system without errors
4. System performance meets or exceeds the original system
5. No data inconsistencies are detected after two weeks of operation
