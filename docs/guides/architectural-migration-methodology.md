# Architectural Migration Methodology
## AI-Assisted Project Management with GitHub Projects

## Overview

This document outlines a revolutionary methodology for handling significant architectural changes in software projects. This approach combines traditional architectural migration practices with AI-assisted project management through GitHub Projects, providing unprecedented control, visibility, and automation for complex software migrations.

**Key Innovation**: Full programmatic control of GitHub Projects through GraphQL API, enabling AI assistants to manage the entire project lifecycle from task creation to completion.

This methodology was developed during the property renderer consolidation effort and represents a significant advancement in systematic, AI-driven software development.

## Core Principles

### 1. Analysis Before Action ($nc Mode)
- **No coding** until complete understanding is achieved
- **Deep analysis** of current state, risks, and implications
- **Research and document** before proposing solutions
- **Present findings** and wait for explicit approval

### 2. GitHub-Driven Planning
- **Create GitHub issues** for all architectural work
- **Task-based breakdown** (not phase-based planning)
- **Proper issue structure** with acceptance criteria and tests
- **Progress tracking** via milestones and meta issues

### 3. Risk-First Assessment
- **Identify critical functionality** that must be preserved
- **Document breaking points** and mitigation strategies
- **Design comprehensive testing** before making changes
- **Plan rollback strategies** for each major change

### 4. AI-Driven Project Management
- **Programmatic GitHub Projects control** through GraphQL API
- **Automated workflow management** with dependency enforcement
- **Intelligent task orchestration** with risk-based prioritization
- **Continuous validation** of acceptance criteria and completion

## Enhanced Methodology with AI Integration

This architectural migration methodology can be significantly enhanced through AI-assisted project management. The AI system provides:

### Key AI Enhancements
- **Automated project setup** with one-command infrastructure creation
- **Intelligent dependency enforcement** preventing premature task starts
- **Real-time progress monitoring** with professional project dashboards
- **Quality gate validation** ensuring acceptance criteria completion
- **Systematic workflow management** with zero manual overhead

### Integration Points
- **Project Setup**: `./setup-complete-github-project.sh` creates complete infrastructure
- **Daily Management**: `./query-project-status.sh` provides real-time project dashboard
- **Task Execution**: `./start-task.sh` and `./complete-task.sh` manage workflow transitions
- **Dependency Analysis**: `./check-dependencies.sh` identifies ready tasks and bottlenecks

The AI system transforms manual project management into systematic, automated workflow orchestration while maintaining all the quality and risk management principles of traditional architectural migration.

## Traditional Methodology Steps

### Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis

#### Step 1: Conduct $nc Analysis
```markdown
**Objective**: Understand current architecture without making changes

**Activities**:
- Read and analyze all relevant code files
- Map data flows and dependencies
- Identify shared vs unique components
- Document architectural differences
- Assess compatibility and migration risks

**Deliverables**:
- Comprehensive analysis document
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- Component mapping and gap analysis
- Testing strategy design
```

#### Step 2: Break Down Into Tasks
```markdown
**Objective**: Convert architectural goals into specific, actionable tasks

**Guidelines**:
- Tasks should be independent where possible
- Focus on deliverable outcomes, not time periods
- Each task should have clear success criteria
- Identify dependencies between tasks
- Estimate effort and complexity

**Avoid**:
- Phase-based planning (phases are timeframes, not tasks)
- Vague or overlapping task definitions
- Tasks without clear acceptance criteria
```

### Phase 2: GitHub Issue Structure

#### Issue Organization Pattern
```markdown
**Structure**: Milestone + Meta Issue + Task Issues

1. **Milestone**: "[Architecture] Migration Name"
   - Groups all related issues
   - Provides progress tracking
   - Sets completion timeline

2. **Meta Issue**: "[META] Architectural change description"
   - Overview of migration effort
   - Links to all sub-issues with checkboxes
   - High-level acceptance criteria
   - Progress summary

3. **Task Issues**: Individual actionable items
   - Specific deliverable outcomes
   - Detailed acceptance criteria with tests
   - Clear success/failure criteria
   - Dependencies noted
```

#### Issue Categorization
```markdown
**Labels to Use**:
- `architecture` - Architectural changes
- `tech-debt` - Technical debt cleanup
- `high-priority` / `medium-priority` / `low-priority`
- `migration` - Migration-specific tasks
- `testing` - Testing and validation tasks
- `documentation` - Documentation updates
- `cleanup` - Code cleanup and archival

**Priority Guidelines**:
- Critical: Revenue-impacting or user-facing functionality
- High: Core architecture or frequently-used components
- Medium: Developer experience or maintainability
- Low: Documentation, cleanup, nice-to-have improvements
```

### Phase 3: Task Categories and Templates

#### Foundation Tasks (Analysis & Planning)
```markdown
**Purpose**: Understand current state and plan migration

**Example Tasks**:
- Create data transformation utilities
- Map component functionality gaps
- Audit integration differences
- Design compatibility layers

**Acceptance Criteria Template**:
- [ ] **AC1**: Analysis completed with documented findings
  - **Test**: Review analysis against checklist
  - **Expected**: All areas covered, risks identified
  - **Edge Cases**: Missing dependencies, undocumented behavior
```

#### Enhancement Tasks (Building New Capabilities)
```markdown
**Purpose**: Extend systems to support migration

**Example Tasks**:
- Extend renderer to support new use cases
- Add missing components to modern system
- Implement compatibility layers

**Acceptance Criteria Template**:
- [ ] **AC1**: New functionality works in isolation
- [ ] **AC2**: Integration with existing system successful
- [ ] **AC3**: Performance meets or exceeds baseline
```

#### Migration Tasks (Actual System Changes)
```markdown
**Purpose**: Replace old system with new system

**Example Tasks**:
- Replace component usage in specific areas
