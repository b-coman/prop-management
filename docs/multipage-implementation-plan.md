# Multi-Page Property Website Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step process for implementing the multi-page property website structure in the RentalSpot application.

## Overview

The current property website uses a single-page architecture with anchored sections. The new multi-page architecture allows each property to have multiple distinct pages (homepage, details, location, gallery, booking) with their own sets of blocks.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create React Components for New Block Types âœ…

- Created all 13 new block components:
  - `PageHeader` - Header for subpages
  - `AmenitiesList` - Property amenities display
  - `RoomsList` - Rooms and accommodations
  - `SpecificationsList` - Property specifications
  - `PricingTable` - Seasonal pricing
  - `FullMap` - Large property location map
  - `AttractionsList` - Nearby attractions
  - `TransportOptions` - Transportation options
  - `DistancesList` - Distances to locations
  - `GalleryGrid` - Full gallery with lightbox
  - `PhotoCategories` - Categorized gallery
  - `FullBookingForm` - Complete booking form
  - `PoliciesList` - Booking policies

### Step 2: Update Firestore Collections

- Create validation and update scripts:
  - `validate-multipage-structure.ts` - Validates template and overrides against schemas
  - `update-multipage-template.ts` - Uploads new template and overrides to Firestore

#### Actions Required:
1. Run `npm run validate-multipage` to validate the new template and overrides
2. Run `npm run update-multipage` to upload to Firestore
3. Verify that the template and overrides are correctly stored in Firestore

### Step 3: Update Routing and Navigation

#### Actions Required:
1. Rename and activate updated routing files:
   - Rename `src/app/properties/[slug]/page-multipage.tsx` to `page.tsx` (after backing up the original)
   - Rename `src/middleware-multipage.ts` to `middleware.ts` (after backing up the original)
   - Ensure the `[...path]` route is active for subpages 

2. Update imports and references to use new components:
   - Update `PropertyPageLayout` to use the new `PropertyPageRenderer`
   - Rename and activate `generic-header-multipage.tsx`

### Step 4: Testing

#### Actions Required:
1. Test the homepage: `/properties/prahova-mountain-chalet`
2. Test all subpages:
   - `/properties/prahova-mountain-chalet/details`
   - `/properties/prahova-mountain-chalet/location`
   - `/properties/prahova-mountain-chalet/gallery`
   - `/properties/prahova-mountain-chalet/booking`
3. Test navigation between pages
4. Test responsiveness on mobile devices
5. Test custom domain resolution (if applicable)

### Step 5: Documentation and Cleanup

#### Actions Required:
1. Update DOCUMENTATION.md with multi-page structure details
2. Remove any temporary or backup files
3. Create a migration guide for existing properties

## Notes on Backward Compatibility

The implementation is designed to maintain backward compatibility:

1. The new schema extends the existing one without breaking changes
2. Single-page properties will continue to work as before
3. The multi-page structure is opt-in based on the template design

## Future Enhancements

1. Add a visual template editor in the admin panel
2. Create more block types for diverse content
3. Add SEO optimization features for each page
4. Implement analytics tracking per page

## Technical Debt and Considerations

1. The current implementation stores the full template and overrides in Firestore, which may lead to larger document sizes. Consider splitting into subcollections for very complex templates.
2. The client-side rendering approach may impact SEO. Consider server-side rendering optimizations.
3. Some block components could benefit from further refactoring for code reuse.

## Migration Guide for Existing Properties

To migrate an existing property to the multi-page structure:

1. Create a multi-page template based on the holiday-house-multipage.json example
2. Create property overrides that match this structure
3. Update the property document to reference the new template
4. Test and verify all pages function correctly
