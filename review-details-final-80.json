The mountain family chalet has 3 bedrooms and 1.5 baths, has a large refrigerator, a freezer and a BBQ. The pictures represent the chalet very well. We checked in late and Bogdan had a a neighbor help us find the chalet and get in. To get to the chalet, drive uphill from the main road on an asphalted road for about 6 minutes. Park next to the chalet and walk down stone steps. It is better not to have heavy luggage. The garden is nice. We had a slight issue with the hot water for the shower but was manageable. The super automatic coffee machine that has coffee beans is a nice touch.

The house fit our needs perfectly: beautiful, quiet, comfortable, private, plenty of extra linens, clean, tons of outdoor space and activities for kids (and adults who want a nap in a hammock). Bogdan was a truly outstanding host: he responded almost immediately to every question we had, with recommendations about local activities and services, quick response to a small electric problem in the house, and really gave the impression that he takes his responsibility as a host very seriously, while being both friendly and professional. As a bonus, there are endless opportunities for playing hide-and-seek around the property :) We really can't recommend this place enough!! Your public reply Thank you Sylvie for your kind and appreciative words. It was a pleasure, and for me it's always a pleasure to see people enjoying a place I built initially for my family and for my kids. Now they are big, they are not playing hide and seek around anymore, but I'm happy to see the place provides the same joy for other kids now :) Delete Edit Private note from Sylvie Bogdan, We wanted to thank you again personally, beyond our public review, for your amazing hospitality. The house was exactly what we needed and was perfect for our kids, for our style of vacation (nature, away from the crowds). Everything about the property was meticulous and professional and as we wrote in the review, we also could tell that you really care about your guests and their experience.

It was very warm and cozy and it offers also some entertainment options like board games, chess or a nice TV.

Good to know: from where you will leave the car to the chalet you have a slope (a rough guess: around 100m, 15 degrees).

The house is even more beautiful than it looks in the photos, is warm, comfortable and fully equipped for both short and long stays. We loved the fresh air, the snow in the winter - the backyard perfect for our son, the sound of birds in the spring and in the summer, and absolutely adored the sound and the look of the sheep in the morning and in the evening in the spring walking by our charming house… Bogdan is a very responsible and responsive host and he’s been there for us whenever we needed it.

We enjoyed all this whilst being also able to work from home, thanks to the powerful internet connection. Access is extremely easy and it spares visitors from most of the crowded week end roads from Valea Prahovei, as it is well placed in an area from Comarnic just before the jam zones. We intend to return here and warmly recommend this location to anyone who wants to spend a relaxing and calm time in the mountains.

The house itself is very cute, everything well laid out and working, a comfortable place to be whatever the weather. It’s also full of little touches that show you it has been Bogdan’s passion, not just a property. The setting is also fabulous, some distance from the road and surrounded by trees and plants, we saw squirrels, hedgehogs, a fox, and many, many different kinds of birds. The terrace overlooks the valley with distant forested hills and mountains in the background. Bogdan was an excellent host, dealing with the few problems we had fast and efficiently, he also left a wonderful basket filled with local foods, eggs, cheese and glorious tomatoes.

You will find what the pictures show. Bogdan is a very responsive and welcoming host. Highly appreciated his implication and fast answers. The breakfast Basket was beautiful, filled with delicious local products: eggs, cheese, milk, fruits and vegetables. The location is beautiful, litterally in the middle of nature but this comes for a cost as access can be quite challenging for those travelling with kids or lots of luggage. From the main road, where you can leave the car, there is quite a steep path down that leads to the house. It is not unduable for grown-ups, but kids might get upset, especiallt if you do it several times a day. Mine cried to be carried all the way up which was not an easy job. All in all it is a beautiful stay if you come prepared or don’t mind a bit of efort. Your public reply Thanks Manuela, it was a pleasure for me too!... I have some plans for improving the path down and make it more enjoyable for the little ones. So, if you'll come back in September your kids will have a better experience, I promise! Delete Edit Private note from Manuela Multumim pentru tot, Bogdan! Am scris in review despre accesul la casuta, poate il descrieti un pic mai clar ca sa setati asteptarile corect mai ales pentru parinti :) A fost singurul lucru major pe care l-as avea de sugerat. Am mai punctat cateva detalii pe care le-as adresa pentru cei care vin cu copii. Casa si zona sunt minunate. Multumim pentru ospitalitate.","privateNote":"","ratings":{"Check-in":5,"Cleanliness":5,"Accuracy":4,"Communication":5,"Location":3,"Value":4},"tags":{},"profilePicturePath":"","airbnbReviewId":"625853721","propertySlug":"prahova-mountain-chalet","source":"airbnb","listingId":"43265214"},{"guestName":"Adrian","dates":"May 15 – 18, 2020","overallRating":5,"publicReview":"We had a great time at Bogdan's place.
