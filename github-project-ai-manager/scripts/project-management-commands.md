# Property Renderer Consolidation - Project Management Commands

This document provides an overview of all available project management commands for the Property Renderer Consolidation effort.

## 🎯 Core Project Management Commands

### 📊 Status & Monitoring
```bash
# Get comprehensive project status dashboard
./query-project-status.sh

# Check dependencies and find tasks ready to unblock
./check-dependencies.sh
```

### 🔄 Task Workflow Management
```bash
# Move foundation tasks to Ready status (run once at start)
./move-foundation-tasks-ready.sh

# Start working on a specific task (moves to In Progress)
./start-task.sh <issue_number>

# Complete a task (moves to Done, checks for dependent tasks)
./complete-task.sh <issue_number> ["completion comment"]

# Move a specific task to Ready (for unblocking)
./move-to-ready.sh <issue_number>
```

### 🚀 Initial Setup
```bash
# Complete GitHub Project setup (run once)
./setup-complete-github-project.sh

# Alternative: Setup repo project (if auth issues)
./setup-repo-project.sh
```

## 📋 Typical Workflow

### 1. Initial Setup (One Time)
```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub (if not already done)
gh auth refresh -s project,read:project --hostname github.com

# Set up the complete GitHub Project
./setup-complete-github-project.sh

# Move foundation tasks to Ready
./move-foundation-tasks-ready.sh
```

### 2. Development Workflow
```bash
# Check what's ready to work on
./query-project-status.sh

# Start a foundation task
./start-task.sh 39  # or 40, 41

# When task is complete
./complete-task.sh 39 "Data transformation utilities implemented and tested"

# Check for newly unblocked tasks
./check-dependencies.sh

# Move unblocked tasks to Ready
./move-to-ready.sh 42
```

### 3. Ongoing Management
```bash
# Regular status monitoring
./query-project-status.sh

# Check for dependency bottlenecks
./check-dependencies.sh

# Move tasks through workflow as needed
./start-task.sh <issue>
./complete-task.sh <issue>
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

### Task Categories & Dependencies
- **🔍 Foundation** (Ready to start): #39, #40, #41
- **⚡ Enhancement** (Blocked): #42 (needs #39,#40,#41), #43 (needs #40), #44 (needs #39)
- **🔄 Migration** (Blocked): #45 (needs #42,#43,#44), #46 (needs #45)
- **🧪 QA** (Blocked): #47, #48 (both need #42)
- **📚 Documentation** (Blocked): #49 (needs #46), #50 (needs #49)

### Status Flow
```
📋 Backlog/Todo → 🔵 Ready → 🟡 In Progress → 🟣 Review → ✅ Done
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ What These Scripts Provide
- **Full project automation** using GitHub GraphQL API
- **Dependency enforcement** - prevents starting blocked tasks
- **Automatic unblocking** - detects when dependent tasks become ready
- **Progress tracking** - comprehensive status dashboards
- **Issue integration** - updates issues with progress comments
- **Risk management** - tracks task types and priorities

### 🔧 Manual Setup Still Needed
1. **Create project views** in GitHub web interface:
   - Board view with status columns
   - Timeline view for Gantt-style tracking
   - Priority matrix view
2. **Set up automation rules** for status transitions
3. **Configure custom field values** (Risk Level, Task Type, Effort)
