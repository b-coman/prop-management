# Service Architecture Changes

## Server-Side Availability Checking

We've implemented a server-side approach for checking property availability. This provides several benefits:

1. **Improved security**: Firestore queries are now performed on the server
2. **Reduced client-side code**: The client makes a simple REST API call
3. **Better data encapsulation**: The Firestore data structure is no longer exposed to the client
4. **Simplified client logic**: All complex queries are handled server-side

### Implementation Details

1. **API Endpoint**:
   - Added a new Next.js API route: `/api/check-availability`
   - This endpoint takes a `propertySlug` and optional `months` parameter
   - It queries Firestore for availability data and returns unavailable dates

2. **Client Integration**:
   - Created a new service file: `availabilityService.ts`
   - The existing `getUnavailableDatesForProperty` function is now implemented using the API endpoint
   - All UI components use this new implementation, making the transition seamless

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - The function signature and return values remain identical
   - There are no changes to UI components or rendering logic
   - All existing forms (Inquiry, Hold, Booking) work with the new implementation

### Testing

When testing, check:
1. Date selection behavior in the calendar
2. Availability status messages
3. Alternative date suggestions
4. Forms for inquiry, hold, and booking

### Debugging

Comprehensive logging is included in both client and server code. Look for:
- Client logs with the `[getUnavailableDatesForProperty]` prefix
- Server logs with the `[API]` prefix in the Next.js server console
