# Language Migration Final Cleanup - December 2025

This folder contains files that were removed during the final cleanup phase of the language migration project.

## Migration Status: COMPLETED ✅

The language migration from query parameters (`?lang=ro`) to path-based detection (`/booking/check/slug/ro`) has been **successfully completed**. All legacy code has been removed from the production system.

## What Remains in Production

The production system now uses **only** the unified, path-based language detection system:

### Active Language System Files
- `src/lib/language-system/LanguageProvider.tsx` - Main language provider (cleaned)
- `src/lib/language-system/useLanguage.ts` - Language hooks (cleaned)
- `src/lib/language-system/language-detection.ts` - Path-based detection only
- `src/lib/language-system/language-types.ts` - Clean type definitions
- `src/lib/language-system/translation-cache.ts` - Translation caching
- `src/lib/language-system/index.ts` - Public API exports (cleaned)

### Active Test Files
- `src/lib/language-system/__tests__/unified-system.test.tsx` - Tests for unified system
- `src/lib/language-system/__tests__/performance.test.tsx` - Performance tests

## Environment Variables Removed

The following environment variables were removed as they are no longer needed:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGUAGE_SYSTEM_MODE=unified` (removed from .env.local)

## Architecture Achieved

✅ **Path-based URLs**: `/booking/check/slug/ro`  
✅ **Clean codebase**: No migration logic  
✅ **Single detection system**: No dual-check overhead  
✅ **SEO-friendly**: Path-based language detection  
✅ **Maintainable**: Simplified code structure  

## Documentation Preserved

The following documentation remains in the main docs folder as permanent reference:
- `docs/implementation/language-system-migration-plan.md`
- `docs/architecture/` - Language system architecture docs
- Migration completion reports in `archive/language-migration/migration-scripts/docs/`

## Final Result

The language system migration is **100% complete**. The RentalSpot application now exclusively uses path-based language detection with full Romanian translation support and a clean, maintainable codebase.
