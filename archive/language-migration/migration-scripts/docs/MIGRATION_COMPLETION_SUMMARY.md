## Technical Achievements

### Core Implementation Delivered
```typescript
// Single unified language system
src/lib/language-system/
├── LanguageProvider.tsx      // Unified context provider
├── useLanguage.ts           // Hook interface
├── language-detection.ts    // Smart detection algorithm
├── translation-cache.ts     // High-performance cache
├── language-types.ts        // Complete TypeScript definitions
└── index.ts                 // Clean exports

// Legacy hook migrated (32 lines vs 256 lines)
src/hooks/useLanguage.ts → Now uses unified system internally
```
