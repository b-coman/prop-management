# Availability Deduplication - Week 1 Progress Report

## Executive Summary

Week 1 of the availability deduplication project has been successfully completed. All foundation tasks have been implemented, allowing the system to safely compare both availability sources without impacting users.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Feature Flag Implementation ✅
- Added three feature flags to control system behavior:
  - `AVAILABILITY_SINGLE_SOURCE`: Controls if we use only availability collection
  - `AVAILABILITY_DUAL_CHECK`: Enables comparison mode
  - `AVAILABILITY_LEGACY_FALLBACK`: Provides instant rollback capability
- Currently running in DUAL_CHECK mode

### 2. API Updates ✅
- **check-pricing API** (Issue #7)
  - Now uses centralized availability service
  - Maintains exact response format
  - Successfully detecting discrepancies
  
### 3. Admin UI Updates ✅
- **Admin Pricing Calendar** (Issue #8)
  - Updates both collections when admin toggles availability
  - Ensures data consistency moving forward
  - Minimal code changes to existing functionality

### 4. Monitoring System ✅
- **Monitoring Endpoint** (Issue #12)
  - Real-time health metrics at `/api/monitoring/availability`
  - Detects discrepancies between collections
  - Tracks system performance
  
- **Admin Dashboard**
  - Visual monitoring interface
  - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
  - Shows feature flag status and health indicators

### 5. Hold Cleanup Automation ✅
- **Cron Endpoint** (Issue #13)
  - `/api/cron/release-holds` ready for Cloud Scheduler
  - Automated script for deployment
  - Comprehensive deployment checklist

## Discrepancies Found

### Confirmed Issues:
1. **June 5, 2025**: 
   - Availability: Unavailable (has hold)
   - PriceCalendars: Available
   - Root cause: Hold not reflected in priceCalendars

2. **June 6, 2025**:
   - Availability: Available
   - PriceCalendars: Unavailable
   - Root cause: Manual update not synced

3. **July 2025**:
   - Availability: No document (all dates unavailable)
   - PriceCalendars: All dates available
   - Root cause: Missing availability initialization

## Performance Metrics

- API response times: Maintained (no degradation)
- Monitoring check duration: ~2-3 seconds
- No increase in error rates
- Zero user impact

## Risk Assessment

- **Current Risk**: LOW
- **Rollback Time**: Instant (environment variable change)
- **Data Integrity**: Protected by DUAL_CHECK mode
- **User Impact**: None

## Next Steps (Week 2)

1. **Data Analysis** (Issue #11)
   - Run comprehensive analysis across all properties
   - Identify all discrepancies
   - Determine cleanup strategy

2. **Data Cleanup**
   - Create scripts to fix inconsistencies
   - Backup data before changes
   - Execute cleanup in batches

3. **Extended Monitoring**
   - Continue monitoring for new discrepancies
   - Document patterns
   - Refine cleanup approach

## Recommendations

1. **Continue in DUAL_CHECK mode** for at least one more week
2. **Do not rush** to SINGLE_SOURCE mode until all discrepancies resolved
3. **Monitor closely** during high-traffic periods
4. **Document all findings** for future reference

## Success Metrics Achieved

- ✅ Zero downtime
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Feature flag system working
- ✅ Monitoring operational
- ✅ Instant rollback available

## Team Notes

The implementation has been remarkably smooth. The careful, minimal-change approach has paid off with no user impact while successfully identifying data inconsistencies that need to be addressed.
